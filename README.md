# bpvoctool
fin whale vocalization analyzing tool in matlab

this code is currently broken and I don't know when I'll get back to it. I don't even know if I broke it or if an updated version of matlab broke it but it is broke.

also note that it requires rdxwavhd.m from the [Triton Software Package](http://cetus.ucsd.edu/technologies_Software.html) to read x.wavs.
