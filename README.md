#spectrogram_truthful_labels.m

this is almost identical to the matlab 2015b m-file spectrogram.m. I've removed the "engineering" units automatic converter so that the y axis always displays in hz and the x axis always displays in seconds. You can be confident no matter how big the file you display is with this function that the units will be consistent.
